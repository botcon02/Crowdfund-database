ER and DDL SQL
==============

Part 1 of the project is on designing an ER data model and translating into a relational database schema, capturing as many of the application constraints as possible.

This folder contains the report, the ER model and the PostgreSQL schema.

Report
======

Application constraints captured are limited as the DDL is restricted to structural constraints (primary/foreign/check), without use of triggers/functions.\
Certain trival constraints, such as specific parameters of tables are left out (e.g. All backers must have their home address registered)

**Constraints captured**
- Each user is identified by their unique email address
- Each backer may only fund the project once before the deadline
- A user may have up to 2 credit cards but must have at least one
- Project is identified by a unique ID auto-generated by the system
- Each project must be created by a creator, there are no projects with no creator
- Each backer can only fund the same project exactly once
- Each project is associated with some reward levels, backers can only back the project at that level
- Each reward level record the minimum amount of money the backer must fund.
- Creators can announce one update to all backers at any single time. 
- Employees will need to approve or reject refund requests
- Each user may only request for refund exactly once
- Employees can verify user and each user can only be verified by at most 1 employee

**Constraints not captured**
- When users first sign up, they must specify whether they are a user/backer or both.
- Backers must fund the project at the minimum amount specified by the reward level
- Backers may choose to refund for request within 90 days of deadline of project

**Nontrival Design decisions**
- ISA Users: Both Creators and Backers are subclasses that share the attribites in Users
- Weak Entity RewardLevels: Can only be uniquely identified by considering Projects
- Weak Entity Refunds: Can only be uniquely identified by considering Funds
- Aggregation of Funds: Refunds are requested by backer funding that specific reward
- Aggregation of Creates: Updated are provided by creators on projects they create
